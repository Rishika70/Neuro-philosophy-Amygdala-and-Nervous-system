# The Amygdala and Nervous Sytemüß†

**A Neurophilosophical Framework Exploring Ego, Attention, Shame, and Love and Liberation**

---

## üß≠ Overview

**The Amygdala and Nervous System* is a conceptual research framework combining neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy to explore the triadic relationship between **ego**, **attention**, and **shame**‚Äîproposing that liberation emerges through **stillness**, **presence**, and **compassion**.

This project reinterprets love not as an emotion but as a **neural field of coherence** and repositions ego as a simulation, attention as stimulation, and shame as the residue of identity negotiation. It draws from both Eastern contemplative wisdom and Western scientific inquiry.

## üîç Core Concepts

- **Ego as Simulation**  
  The ego functions as a constructed simulation of self, emerging from prediction and control mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex.

- **Attention as Stimulation**  
  Attention is a neurophysiological response to novelty, threat, or reward. It guides the self's narrative construction.

- **Shame as Residue**  
  Shame arises at the intersection of identity and perceived otherness‚Äîa residue of misaligned self-recognition.

- **Love as Field**  
  Love is modeled as a non-linear harmonic neural field where identity dissolves and shared presence arises.

- **Unseen Balance**  
  A hidden equilibrium between the brain and body‚Äîexpressed through compassion, reverence, and coherence‚Äîconnects and distinguishes us simultaneously.

- **Liberation through Stillness**  
  A self-regulating path beyond identity via parasympathetic engagement, vagal tone awareness, and non-dual awareness.
